<h2>A. Tropes</h2>
<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td align="justify">

Every film is built from sequences of "tropes" or "cliches". Often there are usual subsequences, where these tropes follow each other in a particular order
(although sometimes unrelated tropes are inserted between members).
Given some film scripts (simply given as a series of trope code numbers), determine how long is the longest common subsequence that occurs in every script
(allowing for some unrelated tropes in the chain).

<h3>Input</h3>

First line is the number of test cases in the current file.
<p>
Each test case is described thus:
<ul>
	<li>Number of series in this test case
	<li>For each series, the length
	<li>Then all member numbers of the series
</ul>

(There is no connection between the test cases.)

<h3>Output</h3>

Output should contain an integer for each testcase seperated by a linebreak. Each integer should be the exact solution for each case: the length of the longest common subsequence.

<table width=100% border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr>
<td valign=top><h3>Example input</h3>
<pre>
1
2
3
10 11 12
2
10 12
</pre>

<td valign=top><h3>Example output</h3>
<pre>
2
</pre>

The longest common subsequence is "10 12", so the solution is 2.
